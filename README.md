# Spotify Mood Classification

This is a python project that categorizes Spotify tracks into four moods (happy, sad, energetic, calm) based on their respective features including danceability, valence, tempo, and more. The program implements KNN algorithms to achieve this task.

The program was completed in a month's time, specifically in March of 2021.

The dataset for this project was retrieved from Kaggle and was created by 'Musicblogger' (https://bit.ly/spotifymusicdataset).

Details on the individual steps I took to complete this project, including normalizing the data and training/testing the KNN algorithm, are presented in my paper: https://bit.ly/spotifyclassification-paper.
