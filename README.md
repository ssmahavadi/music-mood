# Spotify Mood Classification
This is a python project that categorizes Spotify tracks into four moods (happy, sad, energetic, calm) based on their respective features including danceability, valence, tempo, and more. The program implements KNN algorithms to achieve this task.
The project was completed in a month's time, specifically in March of 2021.
