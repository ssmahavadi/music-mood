# Spotify Mood Classification

This is a python project that categorizes Spotify tracks into four moods (happy, sad, energetic, calm) based on their respective features including danceability, valence, tempo, and more. The program implements KNN algorithms to achieve this task.

The program was completed in a month's time, specifically in March of 2021.

The dataset for this project was retrieved from Kaggle and was created by 'Musicblogger' (https://bit.ly/spotifymusicdataset).

I normalized the data from this set by means of my 'data_normalization.py' program, which returned a new file: 'modified_dataset.csv'.
